      <h3>Formally, Mr Evans.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Professionally, I'm a developer, though this is a vague concept. <br>
      My current role encompasses graphic design, marketing and SEO, and photography. <br>
      Hence the photos. I think they're nice. I like design.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, I am studying computer science. <br>
      I've worked with code for years prior. It's useful, and entertaining. <br>
      Outside of studies, I care for how things look. <br> 
      This interest shaped my career——consequentially also this website. <br>
      <br>
      Design in looks and logic is a passion. <br>
      I find my time tends to revolve around this fact. <br>
      <br>
      Now please enjoy my work. <br>
      Or if you feel similarly about design, please <a href="artists">see these artists.</a>
