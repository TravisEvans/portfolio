      <h3>Formally, Mr Travis Evans.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I'm a developer with a few extra skills—graphic design, marketing, SEO, and photography among them.<br>
      I currently work across all of these areas, and yes, the photos here are mine. I think they're nice. <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        I'm studying computer science currently, though I've worked with code for years. <br>
        Outside of study, I've always cared about design—it's a big part of what led me here, and why this site looks the
        way it does.
      </p>
      <br>
      Combining design and logic is a passion that has shaped my career. <br>
      Most of my time tends to revolve around this passion. <br>
      <br>
      Feel free to browse <a href="./projects">my works.</a> <br>
      Or if you feel similarly about design, you might enjoy <a href="../misc/artists">these artists.</a>
